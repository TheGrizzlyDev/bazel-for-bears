# What is bazel?

(Bazel)[https://bazel.build/] is a build system that focuses on speed and reproducibility, while supporting a broad array of different languages. 

Bazel is fully open-source but derives from Google's internal build system called Blaze. Aside from the build tool itself, Bazel has quite an active community involved in extending and simplifying the existing features.

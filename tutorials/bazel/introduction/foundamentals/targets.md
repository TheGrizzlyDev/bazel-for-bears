A target is something that bazel can build. In its simplest form a target is made of:
- any amount of input files
- any amount of output files
- any amount of actions that are responsible of generating outputs

Of course, an action can do much more, but for now we can focus on these 3 things. 

When talking about inputs one must distinguish bazel's two foundamental file types: `generated` files are the files generated by a given target and `source` files are all the other files like source code or configuration files checked-in in the repository. 

Action are atomic commands that given any amount of input files will generate one or more outputs. A good example can be a compilation action that given a source file will generate a binary.
